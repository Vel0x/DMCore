DMCore is a collection of classes and categories to make development simpler.
Instead of having to remember the best practice to shuffle
an array, you can now call `[myArray dm_Shuffle]`. Want
the MD5 of a string? `[myString dm_MD5Hash]`

For all methods have a look at the documentation: <http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DMCore/>

## Installation
